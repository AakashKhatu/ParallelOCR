Preprocess File
    get Scanned File
    get page
    apply transforms - parallel process (if faster)
        grayscale
        contrast
        brightness
        sharpen edges
    compile File
    or
    perform next step per page
Seperate Lines
    find horizontal whitespace 
    divide image by horizontal whitespace
        return cropped image of line
    or
    pass y coordinate of start and end of line
        crop image by line in next step
    assign index no to line
    assign line to process
    save processid with index no of line
Recognize Text - parallel processes
    Tensorflow
        Train
            generate dataset from famous google fonts
            use CNN-RNN with CTC loss to train model on dataset 
                (similar to SimpleHTR but optimised for printed Text)
        Execute
            blob detection for letters (group vertical blobs)
            pass letters to trained model
            Detect spaces
            compile Text
    return text
Compile Page
    arrange returned text according to index and process id
    save as txt or pdf
